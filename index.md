## Experienced in

Skilled CV/ML engineer with strong research and industry background. Experienced in both classical ML and deep learning models. Trained and deployed ML systems with high accuracy. My current work involves developing machine vision systems for health care facilities with 99.99% accuracy.

## Experience

`2016 – 2022`
**Lead Machine Learning & Computer Vision Engineer | InterLink AI**

Projects:

1) Trained and deployed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for pill classification
* Developed multi-view CNN architectures for pill segmentation and fine-grained image classification.
* Trained high throughput CNN models with more than 1000 classes.
* Optimized deep learning models with low memory footprint.
* Reduced product cost by $5K.
* Deployed ML models as an API service with flask framework. 

2) Improved accuracy of pill classification system by 16%.
* Designed ETL pipeline for pill classification system with SQL and Python.
* Explored feature extraction/selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.
* Evaluated supervised ML algorithms to improve accuracy.
* Scaled existing computer vision pipeline to auto-tune/train models on AWS.

3) Worked on an NIH grant research project to deploy a medication administration system.
* Trained end-to-end pill classification system and deployed at a nursing home to administer pills.
* Analyzed and reported results from the study.
* Study found 95% medication error reduction.

4) Trained predictive models to configure pill feeder parameters to process novel pills.
* Reduced time and human effort to configure the device.
* Improved product workflow.

`Sep 2015 - Dec 2015`
**Computer Vision Intern | InterLink AI**
* Researched and implemented automated tuning strategies for machine learning models.

`Jun 2015 - Aug 2015`
**Biomedical Signal and Image Analysis lab Researcher | RIT** 
* Worked on discriminative dictionaries for robust signal classification.
* Researched and implemented dictionary learning and sparse representation techniques to improve signal and image classification.
